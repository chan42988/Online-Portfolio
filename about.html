      I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey and have over two years of professional experience in Digital Advertising. Throughout these years I have been fortunate enough to be employed for cool work such as reviewing Facebook advertisements to working with LG banner advertisements and product data.

      I just finished a three month Web Development Intensive at the New York Code and Design Academy where I learned and improved upon Javascript, JQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SASS, Git, Bootstrap, Postgres, APIs and many other tools needed to create a modern website. These days, I enjoy working part time as a WordPress Developer, and programming a WordPress theme from scratch.

      When I'm not coding I'm strumming my guitar, playing video games, or finding something new to challenge my body. Right now it's Yoga.
