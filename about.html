      After graduating from college I decided to pursue a career in Digital Marketing and Advertising. I started with a paid internship at the American Montessori Society as a Digital Marketing Assistant. During my internship I was offered a chance to interview for a contract position at Facebook Austin. I passed the interview process, and worked at Facebook Austin under a year contract as an Ads Integrity Analyst. After my contract was done I decided to move back to the east coast and eventually found another contract position as a Digital Analyst at HS Ad (formerly known as LG Ad).

      As of right now, I finished my contract position at HS Ad, and am looking to switch careers from Digital Advertising to Website/App/Web App development/design.
